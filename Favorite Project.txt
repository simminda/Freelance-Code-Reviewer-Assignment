The link above is for my favorite project. Originally done in the Hyperion Development
Software Engineering bootcamp the task was to use Python to create a mini "avoid-the-obstacles"
game. I was able to add my own spin on this game over and above the Task requirements.
Custom backgrounds, Win/Lose Screens and royalty free theme music makes this a very
memorable project for me and an exciting glimpse into the potential of future projects
